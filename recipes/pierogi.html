        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from generation to generation. We traditionally make these for Christmas, but they can be made for any special event.</p>
        <p>There's some work involved, but the outcome is rewarding! The boiled pierogies can be fried in butter and onions or served with sour cream.</p>

            <li>1 ½ cups sauerkraut, drained and minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Potato Filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
            <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</li>
            <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
